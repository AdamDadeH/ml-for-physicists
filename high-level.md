ML and (Computational) Physics Overlap :
========================

Sampling : 

 * Hamiltonian Monte Carlo comes full circle to use the power of symplectic geometry to improve sampling.

Generic Experimentation : Inference of model/theory parameters from measured data. For those with prior experience in experimentation or more advanced physics lab courses.
